      <description>I started developing an android app on my surface but then I decided to move the code to my stationary pc. I copied the whole source on a USB stick and pasted it on the other pc. I started the Android Studio and got an error dialog that it was warning me that the android sdk root path(that it was declared on the project) is not valid and I was propmpted to verify so the Android Studio points to the actual and correct path.</description>

      <description>Usually when I am developing mobile apps, I host the server on the cloud. But this time I decided to host it locally on the same machine where I&amp;rsquo;m developing the android app. When I tried to connect to the local webserver from the android emulator by using the local ip, I got connection timeout error after few seconds.
What did I try and it did not work:  Made sure that the required ports of firewall were open.</description>
