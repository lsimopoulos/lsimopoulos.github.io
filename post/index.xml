      <title>Injecting classes that inherit from a generic one in Autofac</title>

      <description>Lets say we have a generic class defined like :
public class Foundation&amp;lt;TClass&amp;gt; where TClass : class { private readonly InjectedClass _injectedClass; protected Foundation(InjectedClass injectedClass) { _injectedClass = injectedClass; } }  Autofac has a method : RegisterGeneric() we can use in order to register generic classes.
Usage :
builder.RegisterGeneric(typeof(Foundation&amp;lt;&amp;gt;)).InstancePerLifetimeScope();  This works perfectly but what about the classes that inherit from this generic class? For example:
public class CustomFoundation&amp;lt;TClass&amp;gt; : Foundation&amp;lt;TClass&amp;gt; where TClass :class { public CustomFoundation(InjectedClass injectedClass) : base(injectedClass) { } }  Using &amp;ldquo;RegisterGeneric()&amp;rdquo; wont work.</description>

      <description>My hdd died two days ago and I re-installed windows 10 Pro(64 bit) and Visual Studio 2017. While I was programming today for one project I came across with the following error : &amp;ldquo;The command is not a valid executable&amp;rdquo;. I did try to find the &amp;ldquo;genguid.exe&amp;rdquo; on the path &amp;ldquo;C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\Tools\&amp;rdquo; but the exe was not there.
I googled around and I found this site. Apparently you need to install the Desktop Developement with C++ in order the CreateGuid to work(see the above image).</description>

      <description>There are few ways to configure an Index on more than one property in the entity framework 6.1. I created a new WebApplication project from Visual Studio and I selected MVC.
1.Attributes
For this tutorial I am going to create two models: Server and Instance.
public class Server { public int Id { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } } public class Instance { public int Id { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } }   Modify the ApplicationUser class:  public class ApplicationUser : IdentityUser { public async Task&amp;lt;ClaimsIdentity&amp;gt; GenerateUserIdentityAsync(UserManager&amp;lt;ApplicationUser&amp;gt; manager) { // Note the authenticationType must match the one defined in CookieAuthenticationOptions.</description>

      <description>I am going to show how to integrate Autofac with the Mvvm Light easy and quickly for most simple scenarios. Autofac is very powerful IOC Container and MVVM Light is one of the best MVVM frameworks.
1.Create a new project from mvvm light templates in the visual studio
2.Install Autofac and Autofac.Extras.CommonServiceLocator as NuGet packages.
3.Expand the folder ViewModel on the SolutionExplorer in the Visual Studio and open the file ViewModelLocator.</description>

      <description>I have been familiar with MVVM framework since the era of Silverlight. I am always trying to follow the approach of &amp;ldquo;clean code behind&amp;rdquo; when it&amp;rsquo;s achievable. One of the big benefits of MVVM is that ,except of the separation of concern, you can make unit tests covering all the logic in the ViewModels.
When using the MVVM pattern sometimes you encounter some challenges. Some functions need to be defined on the code behind which are tight coupled with GUI and include some logic.</description>

      <title>Android: connection timeout error on emulator</title>

      <description>Usually when I am developing mobile apps, I host the server on the cloud. But this time I decided to host it locally on the same machine where I&amp;rsquo;m developing the android app. When I tried to connect to the local webserver from the android emulator by using the local ip, I got connection timeout error after few seconds.
What did I try and it did not work:  Made sure that the required ports of firewall were open.</description>

      <title>Host Hugo on github pages</title>

      <description>This is my first post. I used hugo to make this blog. I totally recommend it. It&amp;rsquo;s really quick to create a blog without the need to install anything extra(no plugins etc).
It took me soIme time to figure out how to host the blog on github pages. I was struggling to deploy the hugo generated static website in github via /docs folder on master branch. It didn&amp;rsquo;t work. Apparently it does not work having docs folder and hugo code on the same branch.</description>
