### Error ###

```
The server returned status code '200 This endpoint is only for web-socket requests' when status code '101' was expected
```
or
```
The server returned status code '400 This endpoint is only for web-socket requests' when status code '101' was expected
```
### Cause ###
```
 services.AddSignalR(options =>
                {
                    options.EnableDetailedErrors = true;
            ---->   options.HandshakeTimeout = TimeSpan.MaxValue;
                })
         .AddMessagePackProtocol();
```
In my case due to network latency I had set HandshakeTimeout to  TimeSpan.MaxValue, which caused the error.
