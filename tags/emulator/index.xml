But this time I decided to host it locally on the same machine where I&amp;rsquo;m developing the android app. When I tried to connect to the local webserver from the android emulator by using the local ip, I got connection timeout error after few seconds.
What did I try and it did not work: Made sure that the required ports of firewall were open.</description></item></channel></rss>
